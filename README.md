# ITconference 2023 Website

This project is a website for a fictive IT conference that showcases some of the things I have learnt through this semester at Fagskolen Kristiania.

## Overview

The ITconference is an annual IT conference held in different cities accross Europe with the purpose of exploring various topics in IT. This year's conference has a focus on frontend technologies, UX design, and responsive design. The target group is anyone interested in joining a conference to develop their knowledge and skills in such topics. A possible participant would visit the site for event details, such as when and where it will take place, what topics it will cover, which speakers will be there, and also check the costs of the different passes one can purchase. 

## Key Points
- **One-pager** The website is a one-pager which is divided into six sections.
- **Navigation** Navigate on the page through clickable links in the navigation bar. Scroll automatically to the top by clicking a button that displays after scrolling far enough down.
- **Components** Interactive components such as accordions, slideshows and radio buttons.
- **Filtering** A dynamic slideshow with filtering options based on previous years of the ITconference.
- **Registration** Easy and interactive registration form that provides feedback for both successful and unsuccessful attempts. 
- **Responsive** Visit the site on different sized devices to see how it adapts. I.e. on smaller screens, the navigation links can be viewed in a hamburger menu.
